# 🔮 Vision: Self-Hosted March

**The Goal:**
A March compiler written in March, using immediate words to manipulate compile-time state.

**The Path:**
1. Implement runtime memory management (Path A)
2. Add essential I/O for bootstrapping (Path C subset)
3. Build outer interpreter in March (Path B)
4. Translate compiler piece by piece from C to March
5. Eventually: Pure March compiler compiling itself

**The Philosophy:**
Context-oriented programming - no AST, just tokens interpreted in different contexts (compile-time vs runtime). Immediate words ARE the compiler.
